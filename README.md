# Stroop-Analysis-Project

The aim of this project is to analyze behavioral data collected during a Stroop task experiment. The study evaluates participants' reaction times (rt) and accuracy (acc) under different task and congruency conditions. The analysis seeks to identify patterns in performance based on the nature of the task and whether the stimuli are congruent or incongruent.
